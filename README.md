Week 6: ANOVA Analysis Part II

Objective: Gain hands-on experience with ANOVA analysis, understanding its assumptions, and applying it to real-world datasets to understand differences among group means.

Instructions:
1. Data Preparation:

    Use the dataset from the power point slides that we did not cover in class (2nd one).
    Download the dataset into a Jupyter notebook or a Python/R file.
    For this assignment, you can use either Python or R. For practice, I recommend using both and having/submitting two separate files or notebooks: one for python and one for R.
    Create a subset of the data that includes only the variables of interest.
    Ensure the data types are appropriate: numbers should be numerical and categories should be strings.
